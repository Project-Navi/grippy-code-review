Grippy reviews pull requests using any OpenAI-compatible model — GPT, Claude, or a local LLM running on your own hardware. It indexes your codebase into a vector store for context-aware analysis, then posts structured findings with scores, verdicts, and escalation paths. It also happens to be a grumpy security auditor who secretly respects good code.

## Why Grippy?

- **Your model, your infrastructure.** Bring your own model. No SaaS dependency, no per-seat fees. Run GPT-5 through OpenAI, Claude through a compatible proxy, or a local model via Ollama or LM Studio.

- **Codebase-aware, not diff-blind.** Grippy embeds your repository into a LanceDB vector index and searches it during review. It understands the code around the diff, not just the diff itself. Most OSS alternatives paywall this behind a hosted tier.

- **Cross-PR memory, not amnesia.** Grippy builds a knowledge graph of your codebase — tracking files, reviews, findings, and import dependencies across every PR. It knows which modules are blast-radius risks, which files have recurring findings, and which authors have patterns worth watching. Tools like CodeRabbit, Greptile, and Qodo charge $20–38/seat/month for comparable cross-PR context. Here, it's free and open-source.

- **Structured output, not just comments.** Every review produces typed findings with severity, confidence, and category. A score out of 100. A verdict (PASS / FAIL / PROVISIONAL). Escalation targets for findings that need human attention.

- **Security-first, not security-added.** Grippy is a security auditor that also reviews code, not the other way around. Dedicated audit modes go deeper than a general-purpose linter.

- **Deterministic rules, not just LLM guesses.** A built-in rule engine runs 6 security rules against every diff before the LLM sees it. Findings are guaranteed — not hallucinated — and the profile gate can fail CI on critical severity hits, independent of model output.

- **It has opinions.** Grippy is a grumpy security auditor persona, not a faceless bot. Good code gets grudging respect. Bad code gets disappointment. The personality keeps reviews readable and honest.

## What it looks like

An inline finding on a PR diff:

> **CRITICAL** | `security` | confidence: 95
>
> **SQL injection via string interpolation**
>
> `query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"` constructs a SQL query from unsanitized input. Use parameterized queries.
>
> *grippy_note: I've seen production databases get wiped by less. Parameterize it or I'm telling the security team.*

A review summary posted as a PR comment:

> **Score: 45/100** | Verdict: **FAIL** | Complexity: STANDARD
>
> 3 findings (1 critical, 1 high, 1 medium) | 1 escalation to security-team
>
> *"I've reviewed thousands of PRs. This one made me mass in-progress a packet of antacids."*

## Quick start

        run: python -m grippy
```

### GitHub Actions (self-hosted LLM)

Grippy works with any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint, including Ollama, LM Studio, and vLLM. We recommend **Devstral-Small 24B at Q4 quantization or higher** — tested during development for structured output compliance and review quality. See the [Self-Hosted LLM Guide](https://github.com/Project-Navi/grippy-code-review/wiki/Self-Hosted-LLM-Guide) on the wiki for full setup instructions.

### Local development

```bash
# With uv (recommended)
uv add "grippy-code-review[persistence]"

# Or with pip
pip install "grippy-code-review[persistence]"
```

## Configuration

Grippy is configured entirely through environment variables.

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `GRIPPY_TRANSPORT` | API transport: `openai` or `local` | Inferred from `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `GRIPPY_MODEL_ID` | Model identifier | `devstral-small-2-24b-instruct-2512` |
| `GRIPPY_BASE_URL` | API endpoint for local transport | `http://localhost:1234/v1` |
| `GRIPPY_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | Embedding model name | `text-embedding-qwen3-embedding-4b` |
| `GRIPPY_API_KEY` | API key for non-OpenAI endpoints | `lm-studio` |
| `GRIPPY_DATA_DIR` | Persistence directory | `./grippy-data` |
| `GRIPPY_TIMEOUT` | Review timeout in seconds (0 = none) | `300` |
| `GRIPPY_PROFILE` | Security profile: `general`, `security`, `strict-security` | `general` |
| `GRIPPY_MODE` | Review mode override | `pr_review` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key (sets transport to `openai`) | — |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub API token (set automatically by Actions) | — |

### Cross-vendor model selection

If your codebase is co-developed with an AI coding assistant, **we strongly recommend running Grippy on a model from a different vendor** than the one that wrote the code. Different model families have different training data, different biases, and different blind spots. A reviewer that shares the same priors as the author is more likely to miss the same classes of bugs. Using a cross-vendor model — for example, reviewing GPT-authored code with Claude, or Claude-authored code with GPT — gives you a genuinely independent audit rather than an echo chamber.

## Security profiles

Grippy's deterministic rule engine is controlled by profiles. Set via `GRIPPY_PROFILE` env var or `--profile` CLI flag (CLI takes priority).

| Profile | Rule engine | Gate threshold | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|
| `general` | Off | — | Standard LLM-only review |
| `security` | On | Fail on ERROR+ | Security-focused CI gate |
| `strict-security` | On | Fail on WARN+ | High-assurance environments |

When a non-`general` profile is active, Grippy runs 6 deterministic rules before the LLM:

| Rule ID | Detects | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `workflow-permissions-expanded` | write/admin permissions, unpinned actions | ERROR / WARN |
| `secrets-in-diff` | API keys, private keys, `.env` additions | CRITICAL / WARN |
| `dangerous-execution-sinks` | unsafe code execution patterns | ERROR |
| `path-traversal-risk` | tainted path variables, `../` patterns | WARN |
| `llm-output-unsanitized` | model output piped to sinks without sanitizer | ERROR |
| `ci-script-execution-risk` | risky CI script patterns, sudo in CI | CRITICAL / WARN |

Rule findings are injected into the LLM context as confirmed facts for explanation.

## Review modes

| Mode | Trigger | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| `pr_review` | Default on PR events | Full code review: correctness, security, style, maintainability |
| `security_audit` | Manual, scheduled, or auto when `profile != general` | Deep security analysis: injection, auth, cryptography, data exposure |
| `governance_check` | Manual or scheduled | Compliance and policy: licensing, access control, audit trails |
| `surprise_audit` | PR title/body contains "production ready" | Full-scope audit with expanded governance checks |
| `cli` | Local invocation | Interactive review for local development and testing |
| `github_app` | GitHub App webhook | Event-driven review via installed GitHub App |

## GitHub Actions outputs

When running as a GitHub Action, Grippy sets these step outputs for downstream workflow logic:

| Output | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `score` | int | Review score 0–100 |
| `verdict` | string | `PASS` / `FAIL` / `PROVISIONAL` |
| `findings-count` | int | Total LLM finding count |
| `merge-blocking` | bool | Whether verdict blocks merge |
| `rule-findings-count` | int | Deterministic rule hit count |
| `rule-gate-failed` | bool | Whether rule gate caused CI failure |
| `profile` | string | Active security profile name |

## Security

Grippy operates in an adversarial environment — PR diffs are untrusted input controlled by any contributor. Defense-in-depth sanitization is applied at every stage of the pipeline, validated by a 44-test adversarial test suite covering 9 attack domains.

**Input sanitization.** All untrusted text (PR metadata, diffs, tool outputs) passes through [navi-sanitize](https://pypi.org/project/navi-sanitize/) for Unicode normalization — stripping invisible characters (ZWSP, bidi overrides, variation selectors), normalizing homoglyphs (Cyrillic/Greek → ASCII), and removing null bytes. This runs before any other processing.

**Prompt injection defense.** Three layers protect the LLM context:
1. **XML escaping** — All context sections (`<diff>`, `<pr_metadata>`, `<rule_findings>`, etc.) are XML-escaped, preventing `</diff><system>...` breakout attacks.
2. **NL injection pattern neutralization** — Seven compiled regex patterns detect and replace natural-language injection attempts (scoring directives, confidence manipulation, system override phrases) with `[BLOCKED]` markers.
3. **Data-fence boundary** — A preamble in the LLM prompt explicitly marks all subsequent content as "USER-PROVIDED DATA only" with instructions to ignore embedded directives.

**Output sanitization.** LLM-generated text passes through a five-stage pipeline before posting to GitHub:

1. **[navi-sanitize](https://pypi.org/project/navi-sanitize/)** — Unicode normalization (same as input stage).
2. **nh3** — Rust-based HTML sanitizer strips all HTML tags from free-text fields.
3. **Markdown image stripping** — Removes `![](url)` syntax to prevent tracking pixels in review comments.
4. **Markdown link rewriting** — Converts `[text](https://url)` to plain text to prevent phishing links.
5. **URL scheme filter** — Removes `javascript:`, `data:`, and `vbscript:` schemes from remaining link syntax.

**Tool output sanitization.** Codebase tool responses (`read_file`, `grep_code`, `list_files`) are sanitized with navi-sanitize and XML-escaped before reaching the LLM, preventing indirect prompt injection through crafted file contents.

**Adversarial test suite.** `tests/test_hostile_environment.py` exercises 44 attack scenarios across Unicode attacks, prompt injection, tool exploitation, output sanitization gaps, information leakage, schema validation attacks, session history poisoning, and more. All 44 pass.
